              <h3>From Childhood Curiosity to Software Development</h3>
              <p>
                As a kid, I found joy in playing basketball and spent 15 years
                honing my skills on the court. Alongside my athletic pursuits, I
                dabbled in the world of technology, experimenting with game
                creation in Scratch and building websites on platforms like Wix
                and WordPress. These early explorations sparked my curiosity and
                ignited a passion for the digital realm.

              <h3>Exploring the Intersection of Design and Development</h3>
              <p>
                During my teenage years, I delved deeper into the world of
                design. I learned to harness the power of Photoshop, discovering
                the importance of aesthetics and the impact they have on user
                experiences. This fusion of creativity and technology captivated
                me, inspiring a desire to bridge the gap between design and
                development.

              <h3>Merging Economics with Coding</h3>
              <p>
                While pursuing my studies in economics, I embarked on a parallel
                journey into the realm of programming. Intrigued by the
                potential of coding, I taught myself Python and embarked on a
                project to create a simple, yet engaging calculator. This
                endeavor ignited a new passion within me, one that compelled me
                to explore the exciting world of software development.

              <h3>Embracing Change: From Economics to Software Development</h3>
              <p>
                Upon graduating with a Masters degree in Economy, I ventured
                into the corporate world, initially as a logistics officer and
                later as a sales manager in the automotive industry. However,
                during this time, I discovered that my true joy and fulfillment
                resided in the realm of software development. This realization
                prompted me to make a transformative decision to shift gears and
                pursue my passion wholeheartedly.

              <p>
                Driven by a burning curiosity and an insatiable thirst for
                knowledge, I embarked on a journey to expand my technical
                expertise. I acquired a professional Scrum Master certificate
                from scrum.org, deepening my understanding of agile
                methodologies and effective project management. I immersed
                myself in programming languages such as C and explored the
                intricacies of web technologies, including HTML, CSS, and
                JavaScript.
