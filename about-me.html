                  <p>
                    As a kid, I found joy in playing basketball and spent 15
                    years honing my skills on the court. Alongside my athletic
                    pursuits, I dabbled in the world of technology,
                    experimenting with game creation in Scratch and building
                    websites on platforms like Wix and WordPress. These early
                    explorations sparked my curiosity and ignited a passion for
                    the digital realm.

                    design. I learned to harness the power of Photoshop,

                    While pursuing my studies in economics, I embarked on a
                    parallel journey into the realm of programming. Intrigued by
                    the potential of coding, I taught myself Python and embarked
                    on a project to create a simple calculator. Which was a lot
                    of fun. Unfortunately, I didn't continue at the time with
                    learning more about software development, as I was already
                    focuses on finishing my studies and basketball.

                    and later as a sales manager in the automotive industry.
