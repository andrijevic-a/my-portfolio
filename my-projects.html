            <p>
              Here, you'll find a showcase of some of the projects I've worked
              on, ranging from simple websites and web apps to more complex
              websites. Feel free to explore and get a glimpse of my skills and
              passion for coding.

                  When I learned HTML and CSS, my first project was creating a website for my dad's company. It was a simple website tailored to his specific needs, incorporating<span id="dots-1">...</span> <span id="more-1">Show more</span><span id="txt-1"> all the essential functions required for the business.</span>
                  <span id="less-1">Show less</span>

              <div class="text-group">
                <h4>Golobe Travel Agency</h4>
                <p>
                  In my second project, I came across a captivating design for a booking website on Figma. I decided to recreate the website from scratch. Although the design lacked a mobile version<span id="dots-2">...</span><span id="more-2"> Show more</span><span id="txt-2">, I successfully replicated the layout and functionality for the
                  desktop version. It's worth noting that this project is
                  frontend-focused, and no backend or server-side functionality
                  is implemented. </span>

                <h4>Todoro</h4>
                <p>
                  After gaining proficiency in JavaScript, I set out to test my skills by designing a web app using Figma. The web app is a comprehensive tool featuring a to-do list, calendar, and finance tracker.<span id="dots-3">..</span> <span id="more-3">Show more</span><span id="txt-3">
                  Users can log their finances, manage tasks,
                  and stay organized. <br> While the project's core functionalities
                  are in place, I'm currently working on adding a backend and
                  database functionality. Once completed, this app will offer
                  enhanced usability and data storage capabilities. <br> I've
                  received positive feedback from my friends, who are eager to
                  use it once it's finished. Furthermore, I have plans to
                  continually update and expand the app with new features in the
                  future. </span>
